# Deploying the music bot to a server

This article will follow the steps to deploy the bot to heroku. You can choose to deploy it on any other server you wish. Feel free to add a documentation if you want to deploy it on other hosting services.

## Deployment To Heroku

Before deploying we need our bot token which you can get after creating a new bot for yourself from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once you have secured your token in a safe place let's move on to deploy our application.

Login to your heroku account and follow the steps :-

1. Fork the project and drop a star :star: .
2. Create a project and name it whatever you want in heroku dashboard.
3. Connect your heroku to your github repository.
4. Set up environmental variables that is your **bot token**.
   1. Go to **settings** --> **config vars** --> Under name add **token** --> paste your token there.
5. Adding buildpacks to heroku,
   1. For this bot you will require three buildpacks.
      1. Python Buildpack (You will get this as an option while choosing buildpack)
      2. [ffmpeg](https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest)
      3. [Opus](https://github.com/xrisk/heroku-opus)
6. Now under the **deploy** section --> choose the repo branch (main in this case) --> click on **deploy branch**.
7. Wait for the build to be successful.
8. To check if everything went as expected, you can click on the left corner dropdown of **more** --> **view logs**.
9. Then go to **Resources** and add appoint your project to a resource.

If you follow the steps, you must have deployed the bot hopefully.
